This project investigates the correlation between website presence and the perceived legitimacy of legal firms. 
Our central question is: "Does having a website indicate legitimacy for legal firms?" Through this analysis,
we aim to underscore the importance of online presence in the legal sector and its potential impact on operational effectiveness. 
Using a dataset from Kaggle containing professional lawyers and legal firms with client feedback reviews across California, 
our research will provide insights that shows if website presence is crucial in establishing credibility for legal entities.
